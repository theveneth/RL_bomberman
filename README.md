# Introduction and motivation
This project aims to develop a reinforcement learning (RL) agent capable of playing the classic game Bomberman at a competitive level. The agent will be trained using an appropriate RL algorithm to learn optimal playing strategies for various scenarios within the game environment.


A game like Bomberman offer a well-defined environment with clear objectives and immediate feedback, making it ideal for exploring and showcasing RL techniques. 


# Objectives
The objectives of the project are the following :

- Formulating RL problem: Describe the representation of the state space (e.g., board layout, agent position, enemy positions), action space (e.g., move, place bomb), and reward function (e.g., points for winning, penalties for dying).
- Selecting/implementing RL algorithm: Specify the chosen algorithm and justify its selection based on the game's characteristics. Briefly describe the implementation details.
- Evaluating agent performance: Define specific metrics for evaluation (e.g., win rate, average score, survival time). Mention how to compare the agent with baselines (e.g., random agent, rule-based agent).
- Experimenting with different approaches: Describe specific variations we plan to explore (e.g., different reward functions, hyperparameter tuning, using multiple agents)
